# MovieLens Data Preparation
This project focuses on analyzing and preparing the MovieLens 1M dataset, which includes one million movie ratings from six thousand users across four thousand movies. The dataset is divided into three tables: ratings, user information, and movie information.

The goal is to demonstrate how to effectively load, clean, and transform the data using Python and Pandas, making it ready for further analysis or use in recommendation systems. While this project does not delve into machine learning, it provides essential data manipulation skills for handling large-scale datasets.
